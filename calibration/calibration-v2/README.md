# Getting Started with Calibration

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that Calibration files generated by v1 and v2 are not currently interchangeable

## Optics Calibration

Due to the nature of 3D printing and assembly, each headset is going to be slightly unique and will require going through a calibration process to display the image correctly.   
  
There are currently two ways to calibrate a Northstar headset. The first method uses two stereo cameras to calculate the 3D position of the displays and reflectors. The second method uses a single stereo camera and is currently set up to be able to use the intel t265 camera, which we currently recommend for 6DOF. This allows Northstar developers to reuse the t265 rather than purchase two separate stereo cameras. 

## Calibrating Hand Position

Hand position is dependent on the position of the leap motion sensor, make sure your Leap motion sensor has the bottom metal bezel hidden behind the 3d printed housing. You can use this application to setup your hand position: [https://github.com/fmaurer/NorthStarToolbox](https://github.com/fmaurer/NorthStarToolbox)

## Calibration Stand Assembly

Version One and Version Two of the calibration setup share the same 3D printable stand. You can find the assembly instructions below. \(Note that they show the instructions for the original dual camera stand\)
