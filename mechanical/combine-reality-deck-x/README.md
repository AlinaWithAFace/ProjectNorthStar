# Combine Reality Deck X

![](../../.gitbook/assets/unknown-4.png)

The Combine Reality Deck X is a variant of Release 3 designed by Noah Zerkin's team at smart-prototyping. It includes a new hub called "The Integrator" which includes microSD card storage, an Arduino and usb hub, an embedded Intel Realsense t261 sensor, and a control board for adjusting ergonomics like ipd and eye relief. 

## 3D Printing Variants

Please note that the github repo for the CombineReality Deck X headset has two versions.   
  
The Prints in the 3.1.1 folder are intended for users who want to upgrade their existing 3.1 headset and also use a t265 sensor. The Prints in the Deck-X folder are intended for most users who are building a headset using the t261 sensor.
